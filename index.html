            <p>I was born and raised in Glendale, Arizona until I was 14. Growing up I had a close group of friends and I participated in a lot of competitive sports. My main sport was swimming, which I enjoyed for roughly ten years. I also played other sports such as football and soccer, and got to study karate for a few years.</p>
            <p>When I moved to the Bay Area it was a very big transition for me being as young as I was, but in the end I believe that it was for the better because it presented me with some amazing opportunities. I was able to attend an incredible coding bootcamp at UC Berkeley where I learned all of the skills to be able to do what I love.</p>
            <p>Living here I continued to swim and began playing waterpolo in high school. High School wasn’t the best for me, but it was a great learning experience. College was roughly the same, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do or who I wanted to be, but things tend to work out in the end. I hope you enjoy my portfolio and I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
